2
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,651
Little girl?

4
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,681
Little girl.

5
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,461
Don't be afraid, OK?

6
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,981
Little girl.

7
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:02,091
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,421
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

9
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,861
I never met a woman who knew
how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,999
They're born thinking the
switch only goes one way... On.

11
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:16,247
They're struck blind the
second they leave a room.

12
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,902
I mean every woman, I ever let
have a key... I swear to God.

13
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:23,087
It's like I... come home,
house is all lit up,

14
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,004
and my job, you see,
apparently... because...

15
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,930
because my chromosomes
happen to be different

16
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,901
cause I then gotta walk
through that house,

17
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,641
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

18
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,491
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

19
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:39,361
Alright, Reverend Shane's
preaching to you now, boy.

20
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,281
The same chick, mind ya.

21
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,971
She'll bitch about global warming.

22
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:49,345
That's when Reverend
Shane wants to

23
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:52,631
quote from the Guy Gospel
and say "Um, darling?"

24
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:56,401
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

25
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:59,698
just figured out that the light
switch see, goes both ways,"

26
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,281
maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

27
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,551
- You say that?
- Yeah.

28
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,771
Anyway, uh... Polite version...

29
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,021
Still man, that...
that earns me this.

30
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:13,681
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

31
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,881
And that's when the
exorcist voice pops out.

32
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,711
"You sound just
like my damn father.

33
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:21,115
"Always, always yelling
about the power bill,"

34
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,261
"telling me to turn
off the damn lights."

35
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,581
What do you say to that?

36
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,201
You know what I wanna say.

37
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,881
I wanna say,"Bitch,
you mean to tell me

38
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,481
you've been hearing
this your entire life

39
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,721
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

40
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:37,811
You know... I don't
actually say that, tho.

41
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:41,201
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

42
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,331
the polite version there...

43
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,321
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,761
So how's it with Lori, man?

45
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:55,341
She's good. She's good
at turning off lights.

46
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:56,631
Really good.

47
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,071
I don't know why
sometimes we guess.

48
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,111
Not what I meant.

49
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,841
We didn't have a great night.

50
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:11,191
Look, man, I may have a... fail to
amuse with my sermon, but I did try.

51
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,141
The least you could do is speak.

52
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:18,941
That's what she always says:
"Speak".

53
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,591
"Speak".

54
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,145
You think I was the
most closed mouth

55
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,231
son of a bitch you'd ever
hear to hear her tell it.

56
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,471
Do you express your thoughts?

57
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,701
You share your feelings
and that kind of stuff?

58
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,551
The thing is...

59
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,391
lately whenever I try...

60
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:47,191
everything I say makes her impatient,
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

61
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,141
It's like she's...

62
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:53,701
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

63
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,451
Look, man, that's just
shit couples go through.

64
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,011
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

65
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,351
Last thing she said this morning?

66
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,401
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

67
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,311
She said that in front of our kid.

68
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,851
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

69
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,471
Difference between men and women?

70
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:29,731
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

71
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,241
Certainly not in front of Carl.

72
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,965
All available units,
high speed pursuit

73
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,171
in progress Lincoln county
units request local assistance.

74
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:47,601
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

75
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:49,951
Proceed with extreme caution.

76
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:04,011
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

77
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,901
Be advised, they have
fired on police officers.

78
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:08,791
One Lincoln county
officer is wounded.

79
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,621
Unit 1, Unit 3.

80
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:22,795
18, 2 miles west of Interstate 85

81
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,811
and we'll patch in Lincoln
County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,291
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:33,841
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3,
we are 10-97 in code 100.

84
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,811
Highway 18, 85 Interstate,
please advise.

85
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,911
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

86
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,921
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

87
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:00,801
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

88
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,111
What I think, Leon,
is that you need to stay focused.

89
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,831
Make sure you got a round in the
chamber and your safety off.

90
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,761
Would be kind of cool to
get on one of them shows.

91
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,641
Holy shit.

92
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,971
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

93
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,301
Put the gun down!

94
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,491
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

95
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,331
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

96
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,931
Me too.

97
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,521
Son of a bitch shot me.

98
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,041
You believe that?

99
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,371
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,671
Yeah.

101
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,471
Shane, you do not tell
Lori that happened.

102
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:29,151
Ever.

103
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,001
You understand...

104
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,971
Rick! Rick! No, no, no!

105
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:40,681
No, no, no, no... He's hurt!

106
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:42,621
Leon!

107
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,465
You get that ambulance down here,

108
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,231
you tell them there's an
officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:50,201
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me?

110
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,021
Okay. Shh, shh,
stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:57,921
Shh, shh, ok?
You stay with me, ok?

112
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:19,121
Hey, bud... We're still here.

113
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,751
We're still hanging in.

114
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,971
Look, I'm sorry, man.

115
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:31,171
I'm mean watching the same
crap every time I come in here.

116
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,571
Everybody pitched in on these.
They uh...

117
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:40,711
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

118
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:43,471
They hope you come back real soon.

119
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:50,121
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

120
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,101
You probably could tell, hmm?

121
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:57,131
I'll just set this on
your side table, ok?

122
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:10,121
That vase has something special.

123
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,251
Fess up.

124
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:14,051
Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

125
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,671
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

126
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:27,181
Shane?

127
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,201
Shane, you in the john?

128
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,081
Nurse, help.

129
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,631
Nurse. Help!

130
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,293
Lori!

131
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:49,853
Lori!

132
00:23:56,613 --> 00:24:00,943
Carl! Carl!

133
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:08,463
Lori! Carl!

134
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:25,563
Lori! Carl!

135
00:24:42,803 --> 00:24:44,783
Is this real?

136
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:46,573
Am I here?

137
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:55,473
Wake, wake up!

138
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:10,723
Daddy, daddy!

139
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:13,283
Carl... Carl?

140
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,573
- I found you...
- Daddy, I got this sumbitch.

141
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,553
I'm gonna smack him dead.

142
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:25,793
He say something?

143
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:27,023
I thought I heard
him say something.

144
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:29,583
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

145
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:33,763
Hey, mister!
What's that bandage for?

146
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,253
- What?
- What kind of wound?

147
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,723
You answer me, damn you!

148
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:42,713
What's your wound?

149
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,763
You tell me!

150
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,793
Or I will kill you.

151
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,023
Got that bandage changed out.

152
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,273
It was pretty rank.

153
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:17,923
What was?

154
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,103
The wound?

155
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,193
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:26,123
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,723
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:34,543
Look, I ask and you answer,
It's common courtesy, right?

159
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:41,103
Did you get bit?

160
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,213
- Bit?
- Bit.

161
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:45,863
Chewed. Maybe scratch?

162
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,953
Anything like that.

163
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:50,873
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,463
Just shot, as far as I know.

165
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,885
Hey... Just let me...

166
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,143
Feels cooler now.

167
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:07,173
Fever would have
killed you by now.

168
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:09,003
I don't think I have one.

169
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:11,993
Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,183
Take a moment,
eh? Look how sharp it is.

171
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:25,723
You try anything... I will kill you
with it, and don't you think I won't.

172
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:38,903
Come on up when you're able.

173
00:28:42,863 --> 00:28:45,173
Come on.

174
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,070
This place... It's
Fred and Cindy Drake's.

175
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,300
Never met them.

176
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,190
I've been here. This is their place

177
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,940
It was empty when we got here.

178
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,300
Don't do that.

179
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,310
They'll see the light.

180
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,890
There's more of them
out there than usual.

181
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,910
I never should have
fired that gun today.

182
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,490
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

183
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,520
Stupid... using a gun...

184
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,210
It all happened so fast...

185
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,030
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

186
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,570
Man?

187
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,440
No man...

188
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,190
What the hell was that out
of your mouth just now?

189
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,260
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

190
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,130
In this street, out front, a man.

191
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,460
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

192
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,310
Come on.

193
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,070
Sit down, before you fall down.

194
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,840
Here. Eat.

195
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,650
Daddy... Blessing...

196
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,550
Yeah.

197
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,260
Father, we thank thee for this food...
Thy blessings...

198
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,680
We ask you to watch over
us in these crazy days.

199
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,210
- Amen.
- Amen.

200
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,500
Hey, mister, do you even
know what is going on?

201
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,970
I woke up today.

202
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,450
In a hospital.

203
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,640
Came home, that's all I know.

204
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,430
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

205
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,730
Out on the loading dock,
hauling trucks.

206
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,710
No... Not the one's they put down...
The one's they didn't.

207
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,980
The walkers.

208
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,190
Like the one I shot today.

209
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,040
Cause he would have
ripped into you.

210
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,700
Try to eat you,
take him some flesh at least.

211
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,770
But I guess if this is the first you're
hearing, I know how it must sound...

212
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,880
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

213
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,500
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

214
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,850
Maybe it's the cool air or... Hell, maybe
it's just me firing up that gun today.

215
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,770
But we'll be fine
long as we stay quiet.

216
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,960
Probably wander off by morning.

217
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,730
Well, listen...

218
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,650
One thing I do know...
Don't you get bit!

219
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,420
We saw your bandage and
that's why we were afraid of.

220
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,100
Bites kill you.

221
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,020
The fever... burns you out.

222
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,020
But then after a while...

223
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,730
You come back.

224
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,850
Seen it happen...

225
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,070
Come on...

226
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,790
Carl... He your son?

227
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,080
William. He said his name today...

228
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,000
He's a little younger...
than your boy.

229
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,740
And he's with his mother?

230
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,010
I hope so.

231
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,080
- Dad?
- Yeah?

232
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,650
Did you ask him?

233
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,170
Your gun shot...
We got a little bet going.

234
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,240
My boy say you're a...
bank robber...

235
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,390
Yeah...That's me.

236
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,720
Deadly as Dillinger Kapow.

237
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,500
Sheriff's deputy

238
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,380
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

239
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,400
It's nothing.

240
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,290
One of them must've
bumped a car...

241
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,070
You sure?

242
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,380
Happened once before.

243
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,370
Went off a few minutes.

244
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,250
Get the light, Dwayne.

245
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
It's the blue one,
down the street.

246
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,100
Same one as last time.

247
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,380
I think we're ok.

248
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,900
That noise... Will it
bring more of them?

249
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,510
Nothing to do about it now.

250
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,720
Just have to wait 'em
out till morning.

251
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,720
She's here.

252
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,010
Don't look.

253
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,440
Get away from the windows.

254
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,930
I said go! Come on!

255
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,650
Come on, quiet.

256
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
It's ok, here.

257
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,480
Cry into the pillow.

258
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,930
Can you remember?

259
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,100
She, uh...

260
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,430
She died in the other room,
on that bed...

261
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,680
Nothin' I can do about it here...
That fever, man...

262
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,980
Her skin gave off
heat like a furnace...

263
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:12,950
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

264
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,030
You know what... I just
didn't have it in me...

265
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,000
She's the mother of my child.

266
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,380
You sure? They're dead.

267
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,330
They have to ask,
at least one more time.

268
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,260
They're dead.

269
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,570
Except for something in the brain.

270
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,060
That's why it's gotta be the head.

271
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
You alright?

272
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,850
Need a moment

273
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,820
They're alive.

274
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,510
My wife and son.

275
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,540
At least they were when they left.

276
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,460
How can you know?

277
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,780
By the look of this place...

278
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,400
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

279
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,520
They packed some clothes.
Not a lot.

280
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,100
But enough to travel.

281
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,810
You know anybody could've broken
in here and stolen clothes, right?

282
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,330
You see the framed
photos on the walls?

283
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,480
Neither do I.

284
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Some random thief took
those too, you think?

285
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,720
My photo albums,
family pictures, all gone.

286
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,210
Photo albums...

287
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,890
My wife... Same thing...

288
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,390
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

289
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,540
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

290
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,650
That's right.

291
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,770
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

292
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,990
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

293
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,920
Military protection food,
shelter... They told people to go there.

294
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,040
Said to be safest.

295
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,180
Plus they got that disease place.

296
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,860
Center for Disease Control.

297
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,040
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

298
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,320
Gas and light have been
down for maybe a month.

299
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,420
Station got its own
propane system.

300
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,360
Pilot's still on.

301
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh, my Lord.

302
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,630
Hot water!

303
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,120
That feels good, right?

304
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,850
* Bring it, bring it, bring it around...
Ahah. *

305
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,880
* What did you say, what...*

306
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,811
Dwayne... Dress in
room back there.

307
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:01,341
- What would you say, Dwayne?
- Thank you.

308
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:09,161
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

309
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:12,541
Safer anyway. People...

310
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:15,171
That's where we were heading.

311
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,631
Things got crazy.

312
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,021
Man, you won't believe.

313
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:18,985
The panic...

314
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:22,641
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

315
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,411
My wife... couldn't travel.

316
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:29,981
No, not with our herds,
so we had to find a place to lay low.

317
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,801
And then, after she died...

318
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:37,521
We just stayed hunkered down.

319
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,281
I guess we just froze in place.

320
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,951
Plan to move on?

321
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,611
Haven't worked up to it yet.

322
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,861
A lot of it's gone missing.

323
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:03,341
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

324
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,891
I'm old enough.

325
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:06,251
Hell yes you're going to learn.

326
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,681
We gotta do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

327
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:10,781
That's right. It's not a toy.

328
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,611
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

329
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,111
Always remember that, Dwayne.

330
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,781
Yes, sir.

331
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,201
Here.

332
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:22,671
Go on.

333
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:28,001
Take that one.

334
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,651
Nothing fancy.

335
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:31,721
Scope's accurate.

336
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,811
Conserve your ammo.

337
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:49,571
Goes faster than you think.
Especially at target practice.

338
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:52,031
Dwayne.

339
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:54,381
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

340
00:41:55,321 --> 00:41:57,541
You sure you won't come along?

341
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:58,691
A few more days...

342
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:02,811
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

343
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:11,591
You got one better.

344
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,371
I'll turn mine on,
a few minutes every day at dawn.

345
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,071
You get up there,
that's how you find me.

346
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:18,731
You think they're here?

347
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:21,001
Can't afford not to. Not anymore.

348
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,311
Look, just one thing.

349
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:25,922
They may not seem like
much one at a time...

350
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:28,291
but in a group all
round up and hungry...

351
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,041
Man, you watch your ass.

352
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:31,781
You too.

353
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:34,891
You a good man, Rick.

354
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,721
I hope you find your wife and son.

355
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,111
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

356
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:42,991
Take care of your old man.

357
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,681
Yes, sir.

358
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:56,181
Leon Bessi?

359
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:02,451
Didn't think much of him.

360
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:07,811
Careless and dumb,
but... can't leave him like this.

361
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,061
You know, if they hear the shot.?

362
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:14,841
Let's not be here
when they show up.

363
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:17,281
Let's go, son. Come on.

364
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:52,561
Read your comic books a while.

365
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:54,671
Daddy'll be upstairs.

366
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,101
Daddy?

367
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:58,841
It's alright, Dwayne.

368
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:02,141
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

369
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,651
Come on, baby.

370
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:06,361
I'm sorry this happened to you.

371
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:01,941
Come on, come on.

372
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,512
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

373
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:00,492
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

374
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,682
Anybody reads, please respond.

375
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,522
Hello. Hello.

376
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:10,102
Can anybody hear my voice?

377
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:15,902
Anybody out there? Anybody hears me,
please respond.

378
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:19,912
Hello, can you hear my voice?

379
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:23,012
Hello? Hello?
Can anybody hear my voice?

380
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,672
Yes, I can hear you.

381
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,742
You're coming through. Over.

382
00:50:29,462 --> 00:50:31,662
Anybody who reads, please respond.

383
00:50:32,052 --> 00:50:34,162
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

384
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:37,032
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

385
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:39,422
Anybody reads, please respond.

386
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,872
We're just outside the city.

387
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:46,882
Damn it.

388
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:49,472
Hello? Hello?

389
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:51,212
He couldn't hear me.
I couldn't warn him.

390
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:52,572
Try to raise him again.

391
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:54,962
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

392
00:50:57,552 --> 00:51:00,092
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

393
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:04,432
This is officer Shane Walsh,

394
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:07,082
broadcasting a person unknown,
please respond.

395
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:15,712
He's gone.

396
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:18,442
There are others.

397
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:19,882
It's not just us.

398
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:20,712
Yeah, We knew there
would be, right,

399
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:22,402
that's why we let the CB on.

400
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:24,652
A lot of good it's been doing.

401
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,380
And I've been saying for a week,

402
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,070
we ought to put signs up on 85

403
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:28,972
to warn people away from the city.

404
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:31,522
Folks got no idea what
they're getting into.

405
00:51:31,642 --> 00:51:34,242
We don't have enough time.

406
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:37,182
I think we need to make time.

407
00:51:37,272 --> 00:51:41,012
Yeah, that, uh... That's
a luxury we can't afford.

408
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,772
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

409
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,352
And who the hell would
you propose to send?

410
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:48,282
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

411
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:50,612
Nobody goes anywhere alone,
you know that.

412
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:57,572
Yes, sir.

413
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:59,502
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
take a sit, buddy.

414
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:01,562
You're alright, go on,
you're alright.

415
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:06,772
What, you're pissed at me?

416
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:11,922
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

417
00:52:13,872 --> 00:52:15,732
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

418
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,432
I'm not doing it for anything.

419
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:18,530
I make you feel like

420
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,902
sometimes you wanna slap
me outside the head...

421
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:21,635
I'll tell you what, girl.

422
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:23,002
You feel that need,
you go right ahead.

423
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,582
I'm right here.

424
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:31,712
You cannot walk off like that,
all half-cocked.

425
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,153
Look, if you don't wanna do it
for my sake or for your sake,

426
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:34,732
that's fine.

427
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:38,342
But just... You do it for him.

428
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:41,852
That boy has been
through too much.

429
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:44,622
And he's not losing
his mother too, ok?

430
00:52:45,222 --> 00:52:48,332
- Okay.
- Ok, fine.

431
00:52:52,112 --> 00:52:54,282
You tell me okay.

432
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:02,262
It's not hard.

433
00:53:21,402 --> 00:53:22,782
Mom?

434
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:28,312
What's up, buddy?
She's in there, go on.

435
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:33,062
I don't want you to worry.

436
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:35,042
Your mom is not going
anywhere. Okay?

437
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,212
Yeah? Yeah?

438
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:40,382
- Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

439
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,590
Hello?

440
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,516
Police officer out here.

441
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,536
Can I borrow some gas?

442
00:54:41,956 --> 00:54:43,116
Hello?

443
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:51,916
Hello? Anybody home?

444
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,836
Easy now, easy.

445
00:56:40,986 --> 00:56:42,866
I'm not gonna hurt you.

446
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:44,966
Nothing like that.

447
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,516
More like a proposal.

448
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:51,646
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

449
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:53,006
It's safe there.

450
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:57,526
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

451
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:01,376
How's that sound?

452
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:07,566
There we go. Good boy. Good boy.

453
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:10,426
Now come with me. Come with me.

454
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:23,126
Let's go easy, ok?

455
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,686
I haven't done this for years.

456
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:36,686
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

457
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:51,969
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

458
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,589
Okay.

459
01:02:42,919 --> 01:02:44,919
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

460
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:11,489
Hey, you.

461
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,729
Dumb ass.

462
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:18,849
Hey, you in the tank.

463
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:20,869
Cozy in there?

464
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:51,899
